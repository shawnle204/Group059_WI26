    "To what extent do pre-college academic indicators predict first-year college academic performance? Using a dataset containing high school GPA, standardized test scores (SAT math and verbal), coursework rigor (e.g., number of AP/IB courses), and high school context (e.g., school competitiveness), we model students’ first-year college performance. This project evaluates the relative and combined predictive power of these variables using regression and classification approaches. We further analyze whether certain preparation profiles systematically overperform or underperform relative to model expectations. This predictive modeling task aims to identify which aspects of high school success transfer most effectively to early college performance.\n"

    "Recent national discussions around college readiness have been brought into sharp focus at UC San Diego, where reports of a growing remedial math placement rate among incoming students have gained mainstream attention. As UCSD students, we were motivated by this issue after the Academic Senate released a Senate–Administration Working Group (SAWG) report analyzing admissions practices and student academic preparedness. The report highlights a notable increase in the number of incoming students requiring remedial-level math instruction, raising concerns about the alignment between pre-college preparation and college-level expectations.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    " This development has prompted broader questions about how well traditional indicators of academic readiness translate into early college success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAWG report attributes part of this trend to changes in UCSD’s admissions landscape, including increased enrollment of students from under-resourced and lower-funded high schools.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    " While the report does not claim that students from these schools are incapable of succeeding, it emphasizes that disparities in access to advanced coursework and academic resources may affect readiness for college-level mathematics. Importantly, the report suggests that commonly used admissions metrics may not fully capture differences in academic preparation, motivating further investigation into which pre-college factors meaningfully predict early college performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research and exploratory projects have examined similar questions using simplified academic datasets. One such example is a publicly documented Kaggle project that analyzed the relationship between high school GPA, SAT scores, and first-year college GPA using linear regression.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup>2</sup>\n",
    " That project found that high school GPA exhibited a slightly stronger correlation with first-year college GPA than SAT scores, suggesting that sustained academic performance may be a better indicator of early college success than standardized testing alone. The analysis also explored gender differences, observing small performance disparities despite similar SAT and high school GPA distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings align with broader education research suggesting that no single pre-college metric fully explains college outcomes. Geiser and Santelices (2007), using University of California admissions and outcomes data, report that high school GPA is a stronger and more consistent predictor of college success than standardized test scores across multiple outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a><sup>3</sup>\n",
    " In a community college placement context, Belfield and Crosta (2012) compared placement-test-only approaches with transcript-based predictors and found that using high school performance indicators can improve placement decisions and reduce misclassification.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a><sup>4</sup>\n",
    " More recent work by Allensworth and Clark (2020), which uses hierarchical modeling across high schools, shows that GPA remains a relatively stable predictor while test-score predictive power varies more across school contexts.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a><sup>5</sup>\n",
    " Together, these methods-based findings suggest that model performance depends on both variable choice and institutional context, not just the algorithm itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on both institutional reporting and prior data-driven projects, our work seeks to extend this line of inquiry by examining a broader set of pre-college academic indicators and their relationship to early college performance. In addition to SAT and high school GPA, prior studies motivate including variables tied to coursework rigor and educational context (for example, AP/IB exposure, first-generation status, and school-resource context) because these factors may mediate how test scores translate into first-year outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a><sup>4</sup><a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a><sup>,5</sup>\n",
    " By situating our analysis within the context of the UCSD remedial math discussion and grounding our variable selection in existing methods-focused literature, this project aims to better understand the practical limits of commonly used readiness metrics and identify which aspects of high school preparation are most strongly associated with first-year college success.\n",

    "Our group hypothesises that high school GPA will be a stronger indicator for first-year college midterm scores than SAT scores after controlling for coursework. Students with high SAT scores but lower high school GPAs are expected not perform as well compared to our model predictions. On the other hand, students with high GPA and standard SAT scores are expected to perform higher, which suggests that sustained academic performance transfers much better to early college success than SAT alone."

    "- The ideal dataset for this project would include a range of academic and demographic variables carefully selected based on their established relationship with first-year college GPA in existing academic literature. The primary predictor variables would include SAT Score (Math and Verbal), High School GPA, number of AP/IB courses completed, demographic background, gender, and first-generation college student status; commonly cited factors towards college performance. A sample size of at least 5,000 entries is targeted to ensure the model has enough data to identify meaningful patterns, reduce variance in predictions, and produce results that generalize well beyond the training set. A smaller sample risks producing an underfitted or unreliable model, particularly when accounting for the diversity of demographic subgroups within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) \n",
    "- Two datasets have currently been identified on key2stats.com, a platform that provides freely accessible statistical datasets for educational use. Both datasets were originally collected from university admissions and academic records, and each contains variables relevant to this project including first-year college GPA, cumulative high school GPA, SAT Math and SAT Verbal scores, first-generation status, demographic background, and gender. Details such as the exact number of samples per dataset and the specific institutions or years the data was drawn from are still being reviewed and will be confirmed upon closer inspection of the files.\n",
    "- A key consideration going forward is how these two datasets will be used in the modeling process. If the datasets share a consistent set of variables and were collected under similar conditions, they will be merged into a single unified dataset to maximize sample size and model robustness. If there are meaningful differences in how variables were recorded or defined across the two datasets, they will be treated and modeled separately, with results compared across both. This decision will be made after a thorough review of each dataset's structure, variable definitions, and any accompanying documentation."
