    "To what extent do pre-college academic indicators predict first-year college academic performance? Using a dataset containing high school GPA, standardized test scores (SAT math and verbal), coursework rigor (e.g., number of AP/IB courses), and high school context (e.g., school competitiveness), we model students’ first-year college performance. This project evaluates the relative and combined predictive power of these variables using regression and classification approaches. We further analyze whether certain preparation profiles systematically overperform or underperform relative to model expectations. This predictive modeling task aims to identify which aspects of high school success transfer most effectively to early college performance.\n"

    "Recent national discussions around college readiness have been brought into sharp focus at UC San Diego, where reports of a growing remedial math placement rate among incoming students have gained mainstream attention. As UCSD students, we were motivated by this issue after the Academic Senate released a Senate–Administration Working Group (SAWG) report analyzing admissions practices and student academic preparedness. The report highlights a notable increase in the number of incoming students requiring remedial-level math instruction, raising concerns about the alignment between pre-college preparation and college-level expectations.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    " This development has prompted broader questions about how well traditional indicators of academic readiness translate into early college success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAWG report attributes part of this trend to changes in UCSD’s admissions landscape, including increased enrollment of students from under-resourced and lower-funded high schools.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    " While the report does not claim that students from these schools are incapable of succeeding, it emphasizes that disparities in access to advanced coursework and academic resources may affect readiness for college-level mathematics. Importantly, the report suggests that commonly used admissions metrics may not fully capture differences in academic preparation, motivating further investigation into which pre-college factors meaningfully predict early college performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research and exploratory projects have examined similar questions using simplified academic datasets. One such example is a publicly documented Kaggle project that analyzed the relationship between high school GPA, SAT scores, and first-year college GPA using linear regression.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup>2</sup>\n",
    " That project found that high school GPA exhibited a slightly stronger correlation with first-year college GPA than SAT scores, suggesting that sustained academic performance may be a better indicator of early college success than standardized testing alone. The analysis also explored gender differences, observing small performance disparities despite similar SAT and high school GPA distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings align with broader education research suggesting that no single pre-college metric fully explains college outcomes. While standardized tests capture certain cognitive skills, high school GPA may reflect longer-term habits such as consistency, time management, and adaptability. However, existing analyses often rely on limited variables and do not account for factors such as coursework rigor or school context, which may play a significant role in shaping academic readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on both institutional reporting and prior data-driven projects, our work seeks to extend this line of inquiry by examining a broader set of pre-college academic indicators and their relationship to early college performance. By situating our analysis within the context of the UCSD remedial math discussion and existing predictive modeling efforts, this project aims to better understand the practical limits of commonly used readiness metrics and identify which aspects of high school preparation are most strongly associated with first-year college success.\n",

    "Our group hypothesises that high school GPA will be a stronger indicator for first-year college midterm scores than SAT scores after controlling for coursework. Students with high SAT scores but lower high school GPAs are expected not perform as well compared to our model predictions. On the other hand, students with high GPA and standard SAT scores are expected to perform higher, which suggests that sustained academic performance transfers much better to early college success than SAT alone."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "> All students are aware that their data would be used. No data was collected through force or secrecy.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " \n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> No names, contact information, or other identifiers were collected or stored. Students will be differentiated using a unique number identifier, eliminating the possibility of PII.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> All data is from public sources and contains no PII; access is limited to project members.\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " > No, individuals will not be able to request for the removal of their data.\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    " > Temporary copies of the dataset will be deleted from local machines once grading is complete. This minimizes long-term risk of unintended reuse. No archival use of the data is planned. Retention is strictly tied to the academic lifecycle of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " > These biases could influence correlations observed in the analysis. So, findings will be framed as descriptive rather than prescriptive. The analysis avoids claims about inherent ability or merit. Observed patterns are interpreted as outcomes shaped by broader educational contexts.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> Axes, scales, and labels are chosen carefully to avoid misleading interpretations. Any uncertainty or variability in the data will be clearly shown when relevant. Visualizations will not be optimized to support a predetermined narrative. Alternative explanations for trends will be acknowledged.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " > No personally identifiable information will be used or displayed during analysis.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    " > Code and analysis steps are version-controlled and clearly commented. This allows future reviewers to trace decisions and identify potential issues. Assumptions made during preprocessing aredocumented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " > Features correlated with socioeconomic status or institutional advantage are not considered in the analysis, making it impossible for the model to rely on discriminatory variables.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " > Tradeoffs between accuracy, interpretability, and robustness are considered. Metrics are chosen to reflect the exploratory goals of the project. No single metric is treated as definitive. Performance results are interpreted within context rather than as absolute measures.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " > Complex models are avoided where simpler explanations suffice. When predictions are discussed, their uncertainty is emphasized as to reduce the risk of inappropriate reliance on the model.\n",
    " - [] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
