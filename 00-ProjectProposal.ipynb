    "To what extent do pre-college academic indicators predict first-year college academic performance? Using a dataset containing high school GPA, standardized test scores (SAT math and verbal), coursework rigor (e.g., number of AP/IB courses), and high school context (e.g., school competitiveness), we model students’ first-year college performance. This project evaluates the relative and combined predictive power of these variables using regression and classification approaches. We further analyze whether certain preparation profiles systematically overperform or underperform relative to model expectations. This predictive modeling task aims to identify which aspects of high school success transfer most effectively to early college performance.\n"

    "Recent national discussions around college readiness have been brought into sharp focus at UC San Diego, where reports of a growing remedial math placement rate among incoming students have gained mainstream attention. As UCSD students, we were motivated by this issue after the Academic Senate released a Senate–Administration Working Group (SAWG) report analyzing admissions practices and student academic preparedness. The report highlights a notable increase in the number of incoming students requiring remedial-level math instruction, raising concerns about the alignment between pre-college preparation and college-level expectations.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    " This development has prompted broader questions about how well traditional indicators of academic readiness translate into early college success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAWG report attributes part of this trend to changes in UCSD’s admissions landscape, including increased enrollment of students from under-resourced and lower-funded high schools.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    " While the report does not claim that students from these schools are incapable of succeeding, it emphasizes that disparities in access to advanced coursework and academic resources may affect readiness for college-level mathematics. Importantly, the report suggests that commonly used admissions metrics may not fully capture differences in academic preparation, motivating further investigation into which pre-college factors meaningfully predict early college performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research and exploratory projects have examined similar questions using simplified academic datasets. One such example is a publicly documented Kaggle project that analyzed the relationship between high school GPA, SAT scores, and first-year college GPA using linear regression.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup>2</sup>\n",
    " That project found that high school GPA exhibited a slightly stronger correlation with first-year college GPA than SAT scores, suggesting that sustained academic performance may be a better indicator of early college success than standardized testing alone. The analysis also explored gender differences, observing small performance disparities despite similar SAT and high school GPA distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings align with broader education research suggesting that no single pre-college metric fully explains college outcomes. While standardized tests capture certain cognitive skills, high school GPA may reflect longer-term habits such as consistency, time management, and adaptability. However, existing analyses often rely on limited variables and do not account for factors such as coursework rigor or school context, which may play a significant role in shaping academic readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on both institutional reporting and prior data-driven projects, our work seeks to extend this line of inquiry by examining a broader set of pre-college academic indicators and their relationship to early college performance. By situating our analysis within the context of the UCSD remedial math discussion and existing predictive modeling efforts, this project aims to better understand the practical limits of commonly used readiness metrics and identify which aspects of high school preparation are most strongly associated with first-year college success.\n",
